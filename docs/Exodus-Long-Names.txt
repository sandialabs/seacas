On write, you can call:

   ex_set_option(exoid, EX_OPT_MAX_NAME_LENGTH, {max_name_length}); or equivalently
   ex_set_max_name_length(exoid, {max_name_length});

which tells the database that you will be using names of that length or shorter.

This same call on read will tell the database to truncate names at
that length. If not called, then the {max_name_length} is assumed to
be 32 characters which has been the historic max name length for
exodus.

Following this call, you can define (i.e., read/write) names of any
size; if longer than {max_name_length}, then they will be truncated
otherwise they will pass through unchanged.

There are three queries that can be made to ex_inquire or
ex_inquire_int: 

* EX_INQ_DB_MAX_ALLOWED_NAME_LENGTH -- returns the value of the
  maximum size that can be specified for max_name_length
  (netcdf/hdf5 limitation)
* EX_INQ_DB_MAX_USED_NAME_LENGTH -- returns the size of the longest
  name on the database.
* EX_INQ_MAX_READ_NAME_LENGTH -- returns the maximum name length
  size that will be passed back to the client. 32 by default,
  set by the previously mentioned ex_set_option() or
  ex_set_max_name_length() call.
