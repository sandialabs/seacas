* --joblog makes a simple log of completed jobs.

* -X now spreads arguments between job slots when reaching last
  argument. Use -j1 to avoid this.

* People on the email list have voted -j+0 to be the new default
  instead of -j9.

* GNU niceload is now part of GNU Parallel. GNU niceload slows down a
  program if the load average is above a certain limit.

* Implemented --tmpdir to buffer standard output and standard error in
  a different place.

* Implemented --load to wait until the load is below a limit before
  starting another job on that computer.

* Implemented --nice set the niceness of jobs running both locally and
  remotely.

* Implemented --dry-run to print the job without running it.

* Implemented --tty as the old default of assigning a tty to the first
  job causes problems.

* Review with focus on clusters. Thanks to Taylor Gillespie

* Quite a few bug fixes and man page updates.


20101202

* Implemented {/} for the input line with the path removed (basename).

* Implemented {/.} for the input line with extension and path removed
  (basename).

* Output from --progress is now sent to standard error instead of
  standard output.

* --eta was broken and counted down from 0. Now fixed.

* Standard output and standard error are flushed after every job so if
  standard output does not end with a newline it will still be grouped
  with the rest of standard output.

* --command, -c, --file, and -f are now removed as options. They were
  never used in practice.

* GetOptionsFromArray rewritten to work with old Perl libraries.

* The file COPYING now contains the GNU General Public License 3

* Major rewrite to make the code more object oriented and easier to
  maintain in the future.

* Using -j myfile the number of jobs can be changed while GNU Parallel
  is running simply by changing the content of myfile.

* Implemented --profile to use different .parallel/config for
  different situations.

* Ugly newlines in $PARALLEL and .parallel/config are no longer
  needed.  Instead you have to use \ in front of special shell
  characters.

* --workdir puts the files transferred to remote machines in a
  specified directory.

* $PARALLEL_PID is set to the process id of GNU Parallel.

* $PARALLEL_SEQ is set to the sequence number of the job.

* -v now only shows the command to run. Use -v -v to show the
   ssh/rsync wrapping.

* Slow spawning error is now only a warning.

* If stdin is a tty and input is read from stdin you now get a
  warning.

* GNU sql: \n and \x0a in arguments is replaced with newline.

* Patch for Debian package and spelling mistakes. Thanks to Rogério
  Brito <rbrito at ime dot usp dot br>

* Mac OS X Homebrew package. Thanks to Jonathan Palardy <jonathan dot

* As usual a bunch of bugfixes and more usage examples in the man
  page.

* GNU Parallel was presented at FSCONS 2010-11-07:
  http://www.fscons.org/fs/gnu-parallel Hopefully the
  video will be online soon.

* Untested Debian and xUbuntu packages available through OpenSUSE
  build service:
  https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?package=parallel&project=home%3Atange

* Using --retries a job will be retried on another computer if it
  fails. This is useful if some jobs fail for no apparent reason (such
  as network failure).

* BSD xargs -o (open /dev/tty) is now default for the job running in
  foreground. Useful for interactive commands like:
  ls | parallel -Xuj1 vi

* GNU sql now supports SQLite.

* Renamed .dburl.aliases to .sql/aliases and /etc/sql/aliases.

* GNU sql now support --list-tables

* Alias for DBURL can contain '?query' part with %-quoting.

* Using --shebang GNU Parallel can be used as the parser for a script.
  E.g: #!/usr/bin/parallel --shebang traceroute (followed by lines of
  hosts)

* First community generated bugfixes

* Alt Linux package of GNU Parallel. Thanks to Michael Shigorin <mike
  at altlinux dot org>

* Sunfreeware package of GNU Parallel. Thanks to Steven M. Christensen

  commands-every-serious-nix-user-should-know/#parallel

* First 1000 views of the intro video

* sql - a small script to access sql bases from the command line which
  is a handy companion to parallel --colsep


20100822

* Counting semaphore functionality: start a job in the background. If
  N jobs are already running, wait for one to complete. Examples:
  sem 'sleep 2; echo foo'; sem 'sleep 1; echo bar'; sem --wait
  sem -j2 'sleep 2; echo foo'; sem -j2 'sleep 1; echo bar'; sem --wait

* With --colsep a table can be used as input. Example:
  cat tab_sep_table | parallel --colsep '\t' echo col1 {1} col2 {2}

* --trim can remove white space around arguments.

* --sshloginfile '..' means use ~/.parallel/sshloginfile

* Zero install package. Thanks to Tim Cuthbertson <tim3d dot junk at
  gmail dot com>

* OpenSUSE package. Thanks to Markus Ammer <mkmm at gmx-topmail dot
  de>

* NixOS package. Thanks to Ludovic Courtès <ludo at gnu dot org>

* Arguments can now be given on the command line. Example:
  parallel bzip2 ::: *.txt

* xapply like functionality. Example:
  parallel diff {1} {2} :::: filelist1 filelist2
  parallel diff {1} {2} ">"{1.}-{2.}.diff :::: filelist1 filelist2

* Arch Linux package. Thanks to Peter Simons <simons at cryp dot to>

* Mandriva package. Thanks to Sandro Cazzaniga <kharec at mandriva dot

* -L -l -n -s now implies -X unless -m is set


20100620

* New video showing the new options.
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpaiGYxkSuQ or at
  http://tinyogg.com/watch/TORaR/ and http://tinyogg.com/watch/hfxKj/

* 100% options complete with xargs. All options for xargs can now be
  used in GNU Parallel - even the more exotic.

* --basefile for transferring basedata. When running jobs on remote
  computers --basefile will transfer files before the first jobs is
  run. It can be used to transfer data that remains the same for each
  job such as scripts or lookup tables.

* --progress shows progress. To see how many jobs is running on each
  server use --progress. It can be turned on even after GNU Parallel
  is started.

* --eta shows estimated time left in seconds.

* --halt-on-error stops if an error occurs. GNU Parallel will default
  to run all jobs - even if some of them fail. With --halt-on-error
  GNU Parallel can ignore errors, wait for the currently running jobs
  to finish, or stop immediately when an error occurs.


20100601

* GNU Parallel now has support for running jobs on remote machines
