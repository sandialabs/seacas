.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR is a shell tool for executing jobs concurrently locally
or using remote computers. A job is typically a single command or a
small script that has to be run for each of the lines in the
input. The typical input is a list of files, a list of hosts, a list
of users, a list of URLs, or a list of tables.
.PP
If you use \fBxargs\fR today you will find \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR very easy to
use as \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR is written to have the same options as
\&\fBxargs\fR. If you write loops in shell, you will find \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR
may be able to replace most of the loops and make them run faster by
running several jobs simultaneously. If you use \fBppss\fR or \fBpexec\fR you
will find \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR will often make the command easier to read.
.PP
\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR makes sure output from the commands is the same output
as you would get had you run the commands sequentially. This makes it
possible to use output from \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR as input for other
programs.
.PP
For each line of input \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR will execute \fIcommand\fR with
the line as arguments. If no \fIcommand\fR is given, the line of input is
executed. Several lines will be run in parallel. \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR can
often be used as a substitute for \fBxargs\fR or \fBcat | bash\fR.
.PP
Before looking at the options you may want to check out the \fB\s-1EXAMPLE\s0\fRs
after the list of options. That will give you an idea of what \s-1GNU\s0
\&\fBparallel\fR is capable of.
.PP
You can also watch the intro video for a quick introduction:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpaiGYxkSuQ or at
http://tinyogg.com/watch/TORaR/ and http://tinyogg.com/watch/hfxKj/
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fIcommand\fR" 9
.IX Item "command"
Command to execute.  If \fIcommand\fR or the following arguments contain
{} every instance will be substituted with the input line.
.Sp
If \fIcommand\fR is given, \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR will behave similar to \fBxargs\fR. If
\&\fIcommand\fR is not given \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR will behave similar to \fBcat | sh\fR.
.IP "\fB{}\fR" 9
.IX Item "{}"
Input line. This is the default replacement string and will normally
be used for putting the argument in the command line. It can be
changed with \fB\-I\fR.
.IP "\fB{.}\fR" 9
.IX Item "{.}"
Input line without extension. This is a specialized replacement string
with the extension removed. If the input line contains \fB.\fR after the
last \fB/\fR the last \fB.\fR till the end of the string will be removed and
\&\fB{.}\fR will be replaced with the remaining. E.g. \fIfoo.jpg\fR becomes
\&\fIfoo\fR, \fIsubdir/foo.jpg\fR becomes \fIsubdir/foo\fR, \fIsub.dir/foo.jpg\fR
becomes \fIsub.dir/foo\fR, \fIsub.dir/bar\fR remains \fIsub.dir/bar\fR. If the
input line does not contain \fB.\fR it will remain unchanged.
.Sp
\&\fB{.}\fR can be used the same places as \fB{}\fR. The replacement string
\&\fB{.}\fR can be changed with \fB\-U\fR.
.IP "\fB{/}\fR (beta testing)" 9
.IX Item "{/} (beta testing)"
Basename of input line. This is a specialized replacement string
with the directory part removed.
.Sp
\&\fB{/}\fR can be used the same places as \fB{}\fR. The replacement string
\&\fB{/}\fR can be changed with \fB\-\-basenamereplace\fR.
.IP "\fB{/.}\fR (beta testing)" 9
.IX Item "{/.} (beta testing)"
Basename of input line without extension. This is a specialized
replacement string with the directory and extension part removed. It
is a combination of \fB{/}\fR and \fB{.}\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB{/.}\fR can be used the same places as \fB{}\fR. The replacement string
\&\fB{/.}\fR can be changed with \fB\-\-basenameextensionreplace\fR.
.IP "\fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR" 9
.IX Item "{n}"
Argument from argument file \fIn\fR or the \fIn\fR'th argument. See \fB\-a\fR
and \fB\-N\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR can be used the same places as \fB{}\fR.
.IP "\fB{\fR\fIn\fR.\fB}\fR" 9
.IX Item "{n.}"
Argument from argument file \fIn\fR or the \fIn\fR'th argument without
extension. It is a combination of \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR and \fB{.}\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB{\fR\fIn\fR.\fB}\fR can be used the same places as \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR.
.IP "\fB{\fR\fIn\fR/\fB}\fR (beta testing)" 9
.IX Item "{n/} (beta testing)"
Basename of argument from argument file \fIn\fR or the \fIn\fR'th argument.
It is a combination of \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR and \fB{/}\fR.  See \fB\-a\fR and \fB\-N\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB{\fR\fIn\fR/\fB}\fR can be used the same places as \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR.
.IP "\fB{\fR\fIn\fR/.\fB}\fR (beta testing)" 9
.IX Item "{n/.} (beta testing)"
Basename of argument from argument file \fIn\fR or the \fIn\fR'th argument
without extension.  It is a combination of \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR, \fB{/}\fR, and
\&\fB{.}\fR.  See \fB\-a\fR and \fB\-N\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB{\fR\fIn\fR/.\fB}\fR can be used the same places as \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR.
.IP "\fB:::\fR \fIarguments\fR" 9
.IX Item "::: arguments"
Use arguments from the command line as input instead of from stdin
(standard input). Unlike other options for \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR \fB:::\fR is
placed after the \fIcommand\fR and before the arguments.
.Sp
The following are equivalent:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&  (echo file1; echo file2) | parallel gzip
\&  parallel gzip ::: file1 file2
\&  parallel gzip {} ::: file1 file2
\&  parallel --arg-sep ,, gzip {} ,, file1 file2
\&  parallel --arg-sep ,, gzip ,, file1 file2
\&  parallel ::: "gzip file1" "gzip file2"
.Ve
.Sp
To avoid treating \fB:::\fR as special use \fB\-\-arg\-sep\fR to set the
argument separator to something else. See also \fB\-\-arg\-sep\fR.
.Sp
stdin (standard input) will be passed to the first process run.
.Sp
If \fB\-\-arg\-file\fR is set arguments from that file will be appended.
.IP "\fB::::\fR \fIargfiles\fR" 9
.IX Item ":::: argfiles"
Another way to write \fB\-a\fR \fIargfile1\fR \fB\-a\fR \fIargfile2\fR ...
.Sp
See \fB\-a\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-null\fR" 9
.IX Item "--null"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-0\fR" 9
.IX Item "-0"
.PD
Use \s-1NUL\s0 as delimiter.  Normally input lines will end in \en
(newline). If they end in \e0 (\s-1NUL\s0), then use this option. It is useful
for processing arguments that may contain \en (newline).
.IP "\fB\-\-arg\-file\fR \fIinput-file\fR" 9
.IX Item "--arg-file input-file"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-a\fR \fIinput-file\fR" 9
.IX Item "-a input-file"
.PD
Read items from the file \fIinput-file\fR instead of stdin (standard input).  If
you use this option, stdin is given to the first process run.
Otherwise, stdin is redirected from /dev/null.
.Sp
If multiple \fB\-a\fR are given, one line will be read from each of the
files. The arguments can be accessed in the command as \fB{1}\fR
\&.. \fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR, so \fB{1}\fR will be a line from the first file, and
\&\fB{6}\fR will refer to the line with the same line number from the 6th
file.
.IP "\fB\-\-arg\-file\-sep\fR \fIsep-str\fR" 9
.IX Item "--arg-file-sep sep-str"
Use \fIsep-str\fR instead of \fB::::\fR as separator string between command
and argument files. Useful if \fB::::\fR is used for something else by the
command.
.Sp
See also: \fB::::\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-arg\-sep\fR \fIsep-str\fR" 9
.IX Item "--arg-sep sep-str"
Use \fIsep-str\fR instead of \fB:::\fR as separator string. Useful if \fB:::\fR
is used for something else by the command.
.Sp
Also useful if you command uses \fB:::\fR but you still want to read
arguments from stdin (standard input): Simply change \fB\-\-arg\-sep\fR to a
string that is not in the command line.
.Sp
See also: \fB:::\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-basefile\fR \fIfile\fR" 9
.IX Item "--basefile file"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-B\fR \fIfile\fR" 9
.IX Item "-B file"
.PD
\&\fIfile\fR will be transferred to each sshlogin before a jobs is
started. It will be removed if \fB\-\-cleanup\fR is active. The file may be
a script to run or some common base data needed for the jobs.
Multiple \fB\-B\fR can be specified to transfer more basefiles. The
\&\fIfile\fR will be transferred the same way as \fB\-\-transfer\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-basenamereplace\fR \fIreplace-str\fR (beta testing)" 9
.IX Item "--basenamereplace replace-str (beta testing)"
Use the replacement string \fIreplace-str\fR instead of \fB{/}\fR for basename of input line.
.IP "\fB\-\-basenameextensionreplace\fR \fIreplace-str\fR (beta testing)" 9
.IX Item "--basenameextensionreplace replace-str (beta testing)"
Use the replacement string \fIreplace-str\fR instead of \fB{/.}\fR for basename of input line without extension.
.IP "\fB\-\-bg\fR (beta testing)" 9
.IX Item "--bg (beta testing)"
Run command in background thus \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR will not wait for
completion of the command before exiting. This is the default if
\&\fB\-\-semaphore\fR is set.
.Sp
See also: \fB\-\-fg\fR
.Sp
Implies \fB\-\-semaphore\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-block\fR \fIsize\fR (beta testing)" 9
.IX Item "--block size (beta testing)"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-block\-size\fR \fIsize\fR (beta testing)" 9
.IX Item "--block-size size (beta testing)"
.PD
Size of block in bytes. The size can be postfixed with K, M, G, or T
which would multiply the size with 1024, 1048576, 1073741824, or
1099511627776 respectively.
.Sp
\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR tries to meet the block size but can be off by the
length of one record.
.Sp
\&\fIsize\fR defaults to 1M.
.Sp
See \fB\-\-pipe\fR for use of this.
.IP "\fB\-\-cleanup\fR" 9
.IX Item "--cleanup"
Remove transferred files. \fB\-\-cleanup\fR will remove the transferred files
on the remote computer after processing is done.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  find log -name '*gz' | parallel \e
\&    --sshlogin server.example.com --transfer --return {.}.bz2 \e
\&    --cleanup "zcat {} | bzip -9 >{.}.bz2"
.Ve
.Sp
With \fB\-\-transfer\fR the file transferred to the remote computer will be
removed on the remote computer.  Directories created will not be removed
\&\- even if they are empty.
.Sp
With \fB\-\-return\fR the file transferred from the remote computer will be
removed on the remote computer.  Directories created will not be removed
\&\- even if they are empty.
.Sp
\&\fB\-\-cleanup\fR is ignored when not used with \fB\-\-transfer\fR or \fB\-\-return\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-colsep\fR \fIregexp\fR" 9
.IX Item "--colsep regexp"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-C\fR \fIregexp\fR" 9
.IX Item "-C regexp"
.PD
Column separator. The input will be treated as a table with \fIregexp\fR
separating the columns. The n'th column can be access using
\&\fB{\fR\fIn\fR\fB}\fR or \fB{\fR\fIn\fR.\fB}\fR. E.g. \fB{3}\fR is the 3rd column.
.Sp
\&\fB\-\-colsep\fR implies \fB\-\-trim rl\fR.
.Sp
\&\fIregexp\fR is a Perl Regular Expression:
http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html
.IP "\fB\-\-delimiter\fR \fIdelim\fR" 9
.IX Item "--delimiter delim"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-d\fR \fIdelim\fR" 9
.IX Item "-d delim"
.PD
Input items are terminated by the specified character.  Quotes and
backslash are not special; every character in the input is taken
literally.  Disables the end-of-file string, which is treated like any
other argument.  This can be used when the input consists of simply
newline-separated items, although it is almost always better to design
your program to use \-\-null where this is possible.  The specified
delimiter may be a single character, a C\-style character escape such
as \en, or an octal or hexadecimal escape code.  Octal and
hexadecimal escape codes are understood as for the printf command.
Multibyte characters are not supported.
.IP "\fB\-E\fR \fIeof-str\fR" 9
.IX Item "-E eof-str"
Set the end of file string to eof\-str.  If the end of file string
occurs as a line of input, the rest of the input is ignored.  If
neither \fB\-E\fR nor \fB\-e\fR is used, no end of file string is used.
.IP "\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR" 9
.IX Item "--dry-run"
Print the job to run on standard output, but do not run the job. Use
\&\fB\-v \-v\fR to include the ssh/rsync wrapping if the job would be run on
a remote computer. Do not count on this literaly, though, as the job
may be scheduled on another computer or the local computer if : is in
the list.
.IP "\fB\-\-eof\fR[=\fIeof-str\fR]" 9
.IX Item "--eof[=eof-str]"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-e\fR[\fIeof-str\fR]" 9
.IX Item "-e[eof-str]"
.PD
This option is a synonym for the \fB\-E\fR option.  Use \fB\-E\fR instead,
because it is \s-1POSIX\s0 compliant for \fBxargs\fR while this option is not.
If \fIeof-str\fR is omitted, there is no end of file string.  If neither
\&\fB\-E\fR nor \fB\-e\fR is used, no end of file string is used.
.IP "\fB\-\-eta\fR" 9
.IX Item "--eta"
Show the estimated number of seconds before finishing. This forces \s-1GNU\s0
\&\fBparallel\fR to read all jobs before starting to find the number of
jobs. \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR normally only reads the next job to run.
Implies \fB\-\-progress\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-fg\fR (beta testing)" 9

Read parameter from file. Use the content of \fIprocfile\fR as parameter

read again and the new number of jobs is computed. If the number is

will edit the file \fImyfile\fR and prepends the file with lines with the
numbers 1 to 3.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  seq 1 3 | parallel sem sed -i -e 'i{}' myfile
.Ve
.PP
As \fImyfile\fR can be very big it is important only one process edits
the file at the same time.
.PP
Name the semaphore to have multiple different semaphores active at the
same time:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  seq 1 3 | parallel sem --id mymutex sed -i -e 'i{}' myfile

.SH "EXAMPLE: Start editor with filenames from stdin (standard input)"

You can use \s-1GNU\s0 Parallel to start interactive programs like emacs or vi:
.PP
\&\fBcat filelist | parallel \-T \-X emacs\fR
.PP
\&\fBcat filelist | parallel \-T \-X vi\fR
.PP
If there are more files than will fit on a single command line, the
editor will be started again with the remaining files.
.SH "EXAMPLE: GNU Parallel as queue system/batch manager"
.IX Header "EXAMPLE: GNU Parallel as queue system/batch manager"
\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR can work as a simple job queue system or batch manager.
The idea is to put the jobs into a file and have \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR read
from that continuously. As \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR will stop at end of file we
use \fBtail\fR to continue reading:
.PP
\&\fBecho \fR>\fBjobqueue\fR; \fBtail \-f jobqueue | parallel\fR
.PP
To submit your jobs to the queue:
.PP
\&\fBecho my_command my_arg \fR>>\fB jobqueue\fR
.PP
You can of course use \fB\-S\fR to distribute the jobs to remote
computers:
.PP
\&\fBecho \fR>\fBjobqueue\fR; \fBtail \-f jobqueue | parallel \-S ..\fR
.PP
There are a two small issues when using \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR as queue
system/batch manager:
.IP "\(bu" 2
You will get a warning if you do not submit JobSlots jobs within the
first second. E.g. if you have 8 cores and use \fB\-j+2\fR you have to submit
10 jobs. These can be dummy jobs (e.g. \fBecho foo\fR). You can also simply
ignore the warning.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Jobs will be run immediately, but output from jobs will only be
printed when JobSlots more jobs has been started. E.g. if you have 10
jobslots then the output from the first completed job will only be
printed when job 11 is started.
.SH "EXAMPLE: GNU Parallel as dir processor"
.IX Header "EXAMPLE: GNU Parallel as dir processor"
If you have a dir in which users drop files that needs to be processed
you can do this on GNU/Linux (If you know what \fBinotifywait\fR is
called on other platforms file a bug report):
.PP
\&\fBinotifywait \-q \-m \-r \-e \s-1CLOSE_WRITE\s0 \-\-format \f(CB%w\fB%f my_dir | parallel
\&\-u echo\fR
.PP
This will run the command \fBecho\fR on each file put into \fBmy_dir\fR or
subdirs of \fBmy_dir\fR.
.PP
The \fB\-u\fR is needed because of a small bug in \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR. If that
proves to be a problem, file a bug report.
.PP
You can of course use \fB\-S\fR to distribute the jobs to remote
computers:
.PP
\&\fBinotifywait \-q \-m \-r \-e \s-1CLOSE_WRITE\s0 \-\-format \f(CB%w\fB%f my_dir | parallel \-S ..
\&\-u echo\fR
.SH "QUOTING"
.IX Header "QUOTING"
\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR is very liberal in quoting. You only need to quote
characters that have special meaning in shell:
.PP
( ) $ ` ' " < > ; | \e
.PP
and depending on context these needs to be quoted, too:
.PP
* ~ & # ! ? space * {
.PP
Therefore most people will never need more quoting than putting '\e'
in front of the special characters.
.PP
However, when you want to use a shell variable you need to quote the
$\-sign. Here is an example using \f(CW$PARALLEL_SEQ\fR. This variable is set
by \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR itself, so the evaluation of the $ must be done by
the sub shell started by \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR:
.PP
\&\fBseq 1 10 | parallel \-N2 echo seq:\e$PARALLEL_SEQ arg1:{1} arg2:{2}\fR
.PP
If the variable is set before \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR starts you can do this:
.PP
\&\fBVAR=this_is_set_before_starting\fR
.PP
\&\fBecho test | parallel echo {} \f(CB$VAR\fB\fR
.PP
Prints: \fBtest this_is_set_before_starting\fR
.PP
It is a little more tricky if the variable contains more than one space in a row:
.PP
\&\fBVAR=\*(L"two  spaces  between  each  word\*(R"\fR
.PP
\&\fBecho test | parallel echo {} \e'\*(L"$VAR\*(R"\e'\fR
.PP
Prints: \fBtest two  spaces  between  each  word\fR
.PP
If the variable should not be evaluated by the shell starting \s-1GNU\s0
\&\fBparallel\fR but be evaluated by the sub shell started by \s-1GNU\s0
\&\fBparallel\fR, then you need to quote it:
.PP
\&\fBecho test | parallel VAR=this_is_set_after_starting \e; echo {} \e$VAR\fR
.PP
Prints: \fBtest this_is_set_after_starting\fR
.PP
It is a little more tricky if the variable contains space:
.PP
\&\fBecho test | parallel VAR='\*(L"two  spaces  between  each  word\*(R"' echo {} \e'\*(L"$VAR\*(R"\e'\fR
.PP
Prints: \fBtest two  spaces  between  each  word\fR
.PP
$$ is the shell variable containing the process id of the shell. This
will print the process id of the shell running \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR:
.PP
\&\fBseq 1 10 | parallel echo $$\fR
.PP
And this will print the process ids of the sub shells started by \s-1GNU\s0
\&\fBparallel\fR.
.PP
\&\fBseq 1 10 | parallel echo \e$\e$\fR
.PP
If the special characters should not be evaluated by the sub shell
then you need to protect it against evaluation from both the shell
starting \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR and the sub shell:
.PP
\&\fBecho test | parallel echo {} \e\e\e$VAR\fR
.PP
Prints: \fBtest \f(CB$VAR\fB\fR
.PP
\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR can protect against evaluation by the sub shell by
using \-q:
.PP
\&\fBecho test | parallel \-q echo {} \e$VAR\fR
.PP
Prints: \fBtest \f(CB$VAR\fB\fR
.PP
This is particularly useful if you have lots of quoting. If you want to run a perl script like this:
.PP
\&\fBperl \-ne '/^\eS+\es+\eS+$/ and print \f(CB$ARGV\fB,\*(L"\en\*(R"' file\fR
.PP
It needs to be quoted like this:
.PP
\&\fBls | parallel  perl \-ne '/^\e\eS+\e\es+\e\eS+\e$/\e and\e print\e \e$ARGV,\e\*(L"\e\en\e\*(R"'\fR
.PP
Notice how spaces, \e's, "'s, and $'s need to be quoted. \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR
can do the quoting by using option \-q:
.PP
\&\fBls | parallel \-q  perl \-ne '/^\eS+\es+\eS+$/ and print \f(CB$ARGV\fB,\*(L"\en\*(R"'\fR
.PP
However, this means you cannot make the sub shell interpret special
characters. For example because of \fB\-q\fR this \s-1WILL\s0 \s-1NOT\s0 \s-1WORK:\s0
.PP
\&\fBls *.gz | parallel \-q "zcat {} \fR>\fB{.}"\fR
.PP
\&\fBls *.gz | parallel \-q "zcat {} | bzip2 \fR>\fB{.}.bz2"\fR
.PP
because > and | need to be interpreted by the sub shell.
.PP
If you get errors like:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  sh: -c: line 0: syntax error near unexpected token
\&  sh: Syntax error: Unterminated quoted string
\&  sh: -c: line 0: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `''
\&  sh: -c: line 1: syntax error: unexpected end of file
.Ve
.PP
then you might try using \fB\-q\fR.
.PP
If you are using \fBbash\fR process substitution like \fB<(cat foo)\fR then
you may try \fB\-q\fR and prepending \fIcommand\fR with \fBbash \-c\fR:
.PP
\&\fBls | parallel \-q bash \-c 'wc \-c <(echo {})'\fR
.PP
Or for substituting output:
.PP
\&\fBls | parallel \-q bash \-c 'tar c {} | tee \fR>\fB(gzip \fR>\fB{}.tar.gz) | bzip2 \fR>\fB{}.tar.bz2'\fR
.PP
\&\fBConclusion\fR: To avoid dealing with the quoting problems it may be
easier just to write a small script and have \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR call that
script.
.SH "LIST RUNNING JOBS"
.IX Header "LIST RUNNING JOBS"
If you want a list of the jobs currently running you can run:
.PP
\&\fBkillall \-USR1 parallel\fR
.PP
\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR will then print the currently running jobs on \s-1STDERR\s0.
.SH "COMPLETE RUNNING JOBS BUT DO NOT START NEW JOBS"
.IX Header "COMPLETE RUNNING JOBS BUT DO NOT START NEW JOBS"
If you regret starting a lot of jobs you can simply break \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR,
but if you want to make sure you do not have halfcompleted jobs you
should send the signal \fB\s-1SIGTERM\s0\fR to \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR:
.PP
\&\fBkillall \-TERM parallel\fR
.PP
This will tell \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR to not start any new jobs, but wait until
the currently running jobs are finished before exiting.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.IP "$PARALLEL_PID" 9
.IX Item "$PARALLEL_PID"
The environment variable \f(CW$PARALLEL_PID\fR is set by \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR and
is visible to the jobs started from \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR. This makes it
possible for the jobs to communicate directly to \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR.
Remember to quote the $, so it gets evaluated by the correct
shell.
.Sp
\&\fBExample:\fR If each of the jobs tests a solution and one of jobs finds
the solution the job can tell \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR not to start more jobs

computer.
.IP "$PARALLEL_SEQ" 9
.IX Item "$PARALLEL_SEQ"
$PARALLEL_SEQ will be set to the sequence number of the job
running. Remember to quote the $, so it gets evaluated by the correct

.IX Item "$TMPDIR"
Directory for temporary files. See: \fB\-\-tmpdir\fR.
.IP "$PARALLEL" 9
.IX Item "$PARALLEL"
The environment variable \f(CW$PARALLEL\fR will be used as default options for
\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR. If the variable contains special shell characters
(e.g. $, *, or space) then these need to be to be escaped with \e.
.Sp
\&\fBExample:\fR
.Sp
\&\fBcat list | parallel \-j1 \-k \-v ls\fR

.Sp
\&\fBcat list | parallel \-j1 \-k \-v \-S\*(L"myssh user@server\*(R" ls\fR
.Sp
can be written as:
.Sp
\&\fBcat list | PARALLEL='\-kvj1 \-S myssh\e user@server' parallel echo\fR
.Sp
Notice the \e in the middle is needed because 'myssh' and 'user@server'
must be one argument.
.SH "DEFAULT PROFILE (CONFIG FILE)"
.IX Header "DEFAULT PROFILE (CONFIG FILE)"
The file ~/.parallel/config (formerly known as .parallelrc) will be
read if it exists.  Lines starting with '#' will be ignored. It can be
formatted like the environment variable \f(CW$PARALLEL\fR, but it is often
easier to simply put each option on its own line.
.PP
Options on the command line takes precedence over the environment
variable \f(CW$PARALLEL\fR which takes precedence over the file
~/.parallel/config.
.SH "PROFILE FILES"

\&\fBxargs\fR offer some of the same possibilites as \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR.
.PP
\&\fBxargs\fR deals badly with special characters (such as space, ' and

.PP
.Vb 5
\&  touch important_file
\&  touch 'not important_file'
\&  ls not* | xargs rm
\&  mkdir -p "My brother's 12\e" records"
\&  ls | xargs rmdir
.Ve
.PP
You can specify \fB\-0\fR or \fB\-d \*(L"\en\*(R"\fR, but many input generators are not
optimized for using \fB\s-1NUL\s0\fR as separator but are optimized for
\&\fBnewline\fR as separator. E.g \fBhead\fR, \fBtail\fR, \fBawk\fR, \fBls\fR, \fBecho\fR,
\&\fBsed\fR, \fBtar \-v\fR, \fBperl\fR (\fB\-0\fR and \e0 instead of \en), \fBlocate\fR
(requires using \fB\-0\fR), \fBfind\fR (requires using \fB\-print0\fR), \fBgrep\fR
(requires user to use \fB\-z\fR or \fB\-Z\fR), \fBsort\fR (requires using \fB\-z\fR).
.PP
So \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR's newline separation can be emulated with:
.PP
\&\fBcat | xargs \-d \*(L"\en\*(R" \-n1 \f(BIcommand\fB\fR
.PP
\&\fBxargs\fR can run a given number of jobs in parallel, but has no
support for running number-of-cpu-cores jobs in parallel.
.PP
\&\fBxargs\fR has no support for grouping the output, therefore output may
run together, e.g. the first half of a line is from one process and
the last half of the line is from another process. The example
\&\fBParallel grep\fR cannot be done reliably with \fBxargs\fR because of
this. To see this in action try:
.PP
.Vb 8

\&  ls -l out*
\&  md5sum out*
.Ve
.PP
\&\fBxargs\fR has no support for keeping the order of the output, therefore
if running jobs in parallel using \fBxargs\fR the output of the second
job cannot be postponed till the first job is done.
.PP
\&\fBxargs\fR has no support for running jobs on remote computers.

\&\fBxargs\fR has no support for context replace, so you will have to create the

.IX Subsection "DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ppss AND GNU Parallel"
\&\fBppss\fR is also a tool for running jobs in parallel.
.PP
The output of \fBppss\fR is status information and thus not useful for
using as input for another command. The output from the jobs are put
into files.
.PP
The argument replace string ($ITEM) cannot be changed. Arguments must
be quoted \- thus arguments containing special characters (space '"&!*)
may cause problems. More than one argument is not supported. File
names containing newlines are not processed correctly. When reading
input from a file null cannot be used terminator. \fBppss\fR needs to
read the whole input file before starting any jobs.
.PP
Output and status information is stored in ppss_dir and thus requires
cleanup when completed. If the dir is not removed before running
\&\fBppss\fR again it may cause nothing to happen as \fBppss\fR thinks the
task is already done. \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR will normally not need cleaning
up if running locally and will only need cleaning up if stopped
abnormally and running remote (\fB\-\-cleanup\fR may not complete if
stopped abnormally). The example \fBParallel grep\fR would require extra

\&\fBprll\fR is also a tool for running jobs in parallel. It does not
support running jobs on remote computers.
.PP
\&\fBprll\fR encourages using \s-1BASH\s0 aliases and \s-1BASH\s0 functions instead of
scripts. \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR can use the aliases and functions that are
defined at login (using: \fBparallel bash \-ci myalias\fR) but it will
never support running aliases and functions that are defined defined
later (see why

composed commands work just fine.
.PP
\&\fBprll\fR generates a lot of status information on \s-1STDERR\s0 which makes it
harder to use the \s-1STDERR\s0 output of the job directly as input for

.IX Subsection "DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ClusterSSH AND GNU Parallel"
ClusterSSH solves a different problem than \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR.
.PP
ClusterSSH runs the same command with the same arguments on a list of
computers \- one per computer. This is typically used for administrating
several computers that are almost identical.
.PP
\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR runs the same (or different) commands with different
arguments in parallel possibly using remote computers to help
computing. If more than one computer is listed in \fB\-S\fR \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR may
only use one of these (e.g. if there are 8 jobs to be run and one
computer has 8 cores).
.PP
\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR can be used as a poor\-man's version of ClusterSSH:

.IX Subsection "Quoting of newline"
Because of the way newline is quoted this will not work:
.PP

echo 1,2,3 | parallel \-vkd, echo a{}
.Sh "Startup speed"
.IX Subsection "Startup speed"
\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR is slow at starting up. Half of the startup time on
the local computer is spent finding the maximal length of a command
line. Setting \fB\-s\fR will remove this part of the startup time.
.PP
When using multiple computers \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel\fR opens \fBssh\fR connections
to them to figure out how many connections can be used reliably
simultaneously (Namely \s-1SSHD\s0's MaxStartup). This test is done for each
host in serial, so if your \-\-sshloginfile contains many hosts it may
be slow.
.Sh "\-\-nice limits command length"
.IX Subsection "--nice limits command length"
The current implementation of \fB\-\-nice\fR is too pessimistic in the max
allowed command length. It only uses a little more than half of what
it could. This affects \-X and \-m. If this becomes a real problem for
you file a bug\-report.
