.IX Title "SEM 1"
.TH SEM 1 "2011-01-21" "20110122" "parallel"
.SH "NAME"
sem \- semaphore for executing shell command lines in parallel
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBsem\fR [\-\-fg] [\-\-id <id>] [\-\-timeout <secs>] [\-j <num>] [\-\-wait] command
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\s-1GNU\s0 \fBsem\fR is an alias for \s-1GNU\s0 \fBparallel \-\-semaphore\fR.
.PP
It works as a tool for executing shell commands in parallel. \s-1GNU\s0
\&\fBsem\fR acts as a counting semaphore. When \s-1GNU\s0 \fBsem\fR is called with
command it will start the command in the background. When \fInum\fR
number of commands are running in the background, \s-1GNU\s0 \fBsem\fR will wait
for one of these to complete before starting another command.
.PP
Before looking at the options you may want to check out the examples
after the list of options. That will give you an idea of what \s-1GNU\s0
\&\fBsem\fR is capable of.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fIcommand\fR" 9
.IX Item "command"
Command to execute. The command may be followed by arguments for the command.
.IP "\fB\-\-count\fR \fIN\fR" 9
.IX Item "--count N"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-j\fR \fIN\fR" 9
.IX Item "-j N"
.PD
Run up to N commands in parallel. Default is 1 thus acting like a
mutex.
.IP "\fB\-\-id\fR \fIid\fR" 9
.IX Item "--id id"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-i\fR \fIid\fR" 9
.IX Item "-i id"
.PD
Use \fBid\fR as the name of the semaphore. Default is the name of the
controlling tty (output from \fBtty\fR).
.Sp
The default normally works as expected when used interactively, but
when used in a script \fIid\fR should be set. $$ is often a good value.
.IP "\fB\-\-fg\fR" 9
.IX Item "--fg"
Do not put command in background.
.IP "\fB\-\-timeout\fR \fIsecs\fR (not implemented)" 9
.IX Item "--timeout secs (not implemented)"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-t\fR \fIsecs\fR (not implemented)" 9
.IX Item "-t secs (not implemented)"
.PD
If the semaphore is not released within \fIsecs\fR seconds, take it anyway.
.IP "\fB\-\-wait\fR" 9
.IX Item "--wait"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-w\fR" 9
.IX Item "-w"
.PD
Wait for all commands to complete.
.SH "EXAMPLE: Gzipping *.log"

available.

.SH "EXAMPLE: Protecting pod2html from itself"
.IX Header "EXAMPLE: Protecting pod2html from itself"
pod2html creates two files: pod2htmd.tmp and pod2htmi.tmp which it
does not clean up. It uses these two files for a short time. But if
you run multiple pod2html in parallel (e.g. in a Makefile with make
\&\-j) you need to protect pod2html from running twice at the same
time. \fBsem\fR running as a mutex will do just that:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  sem --fg --id pod2html pod2html foo.pod > foo.html
\&  sem --fg --id pod2html rm -f pod2htmd.tmp pod2htmi.tmp
.Ve
