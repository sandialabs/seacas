C Type:	Open Source Software
C
C The Department of Energy (DOE), by memo dated 06/10/2009, has granted

C
C In accordance with the DOE's permission:
C
C All copies of "SVDI Ver. 1.1" that are released under an Open Source

C DE-AC04-94AL85000 with Sandia Corporation, the U.S. Government retains

C
C The above notice should appear before the OSS license, and the above
C notice and the OSS license are the ONLY terms that should appear in
C the software or the associated web site. No other disclaimers or
C notices should be used.
C
C The primary vehicle for distribution of "SVDI Ver. 1.1" should be the
C OSS license and associated web site. However, if "SVDI Ver. 1.1" is to
C be released without an OSS license it should be marked: Copyright
C (year first published) Sandia Corporation. Under the terms of Contract
C DE-AC04-94AL85000, there is a non-exclusive license for use of this
C work by or on behalf of the U.S. Government. Export of this program
C may require a license from the United States Government.
C
C At a minimum, this copyright notice should be on the package
C containing the program. Preferably, the copyright notice should also
C be incorporated into the source code and be displayed on at least the
C first screen that comes up when the software is run. In addition, the
C following complete language should also be included in the copyright
C notice:
C
