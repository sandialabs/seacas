/*
 * OVERVIEW
 *
 * This file contains a jacket routine written in C for interfacing Fortran
 * ExodusII function calls to the actual C binding for ExodusII.  This code
 * is written explicitly for M4__SYSTEM.  In general, these functions handle
 * character-string parameter conventions, convert between
 * column-major-order arrays and row-major-order arrays, and map between
 * array indices beginning at one and array indices beginning at zero.
